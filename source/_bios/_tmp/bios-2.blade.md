excerpt: 'Our efforts continue to repair the long history of inequitable systems and financial institutions excluding Black, Latino and other people and communities of color. I am pleased to share with you the progress we’ve made over the past year in redefining LIIF’s role in the community development ecosystem. In 2020, we set a goal to drive $5 billion in investments over the next decade to advance racial equity. Two years in, or 20% of the way, we are 26% there, having driven approximately $1.3 billion.'
