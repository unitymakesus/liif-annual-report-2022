excerpt: 'Dear Friends, As we continue to forge through the COVID-19 pandemic, LIIF, like everyone else, has been focused on redefining our “normal.” Interestingly, it feels not far off course from what we originally charted in 2019 for this strategic plan. Halfway through this trans-formational four-year plan, we feel even more confident that had we known what we know now, our priorities would be the same: We need to center racial equity across impact-led lending, affordable housing, and early care and education, so everyone in the United States can benefit from living in a community of opportunity, equity and well-being.'
