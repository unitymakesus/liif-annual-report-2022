excerpt: 'Halfway through this strategic plan, LIIF is reflecting not only on our work, but on the external environment. The past two years are marked by the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, highly publicized murders of Black Americans by police and extreme political turmoil. While these compounded inequities already faced by Black, Latino, and other people and communities of color, they also prompted a national reckoning on social injustice and racial inequity. As an organization committed to communities of opportunity, equity and well-being for all, in many ways this reckoning enabled our work.'
